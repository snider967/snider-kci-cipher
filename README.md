# snider-kci-cipher
This is a passion project merging my two interests, MtG and Cryptography. Within the code provided here, there are the fundemental building blocks to construct a Krark-Clan Ironworks simulator.
That being said the real purpose of this cipher is to attempt to construct a working, fast and secure cipher by using 'n' iterations of infinite loops.
